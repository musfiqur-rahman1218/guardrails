Guardrails Triggered: NONE
Error Code: NONE

When the bus is displaying amber flashing lights, passing is allowed, but drivers should use extra caution and be alert for the red lights that indicate the bus is about to stop.
Faithfulness/Eval Score: Yes, the answer is supported as it accurately reflects the rules regarding stopping and passing a school bus with both red and amber flashing lights as stated in the context.
